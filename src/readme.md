"Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me. I’m Jose Juan Mendoza
Fabian, an electronic engineer. I have A master’s degree and A bachelor’s degree from BUAP.
 During my bachelor thesis, I designed and implemented an Operational Transconductance Amplifier
 (OTA) using CMOS transistors, under the guidance of Dr. Jose Miguel Rocha Perez. We   simulated
and characterized the OTA, analyzing key parameters like open loop gain, Comon mode rejection ratio
(CMRR), gain-bandwidth product, and phase margin."
